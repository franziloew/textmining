# Software-packages

## A) R-Packages

- [**tm**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tm/versions/0.6-2?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=10907-287229) Mostly-used framework for text mining applications
- [**tidytext**](http://tidytextmining.com/) A text-mining framework using tidy data principles.
- [**SnowballC**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/SnowballC/versions/0.5.1) A text stemming library based on the C libstemmer UTF-8 library
- [**Wordcloud**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/wordcloud/versions/2.5/topics/wordcloud) For plotting a word cloud in R
- [**topicmodels**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/topicmodels/versions/0.2-6)
  - Widely used package to implement topic models.
  - It provides an interface to the GSL C and C++ code for topic models by [Blei et al.(2003)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=944937) and [Phan et al. (2008)]((https://doi.org/10.1145/1367497.1367510)) For the earlier it uses Variational EM, for the latter Gibbs Sampling. (See this [documentation](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i13/paper)). The package works well with the utilities from the tm package.

- [**lda**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/lda/versions/1.4.2)
  - Implements latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and related models. This includes (but is not limited to) sLDA, corrLDA, and the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel.
  - Uses a collapsed Gibbs Sampler for a number of models similar to those from the GSL library.

- [**stm**](http://www.structuraltopicmodel.com/) For the Structural Topic Model

## B) Python-Packages

- [**text mining 1.0 package**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/textmining/1.0) contains a variety of useful functions for text mining in Python.
- [**nltk package**](http://www.nltk.org/) A natural language toolkit. This package can be extremely useful because you have easy access to over 50 [corpora and lexical resources](http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/).
- [**Tweepy package**](http://www.tweepy.org/) An often-used package to scrape and mine Twitter data.
- [**gensim**](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) To implement Topic Models in Python.
