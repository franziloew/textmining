# Websites, Tutorials & Blogs

## 1. Theory
- **Stephen Hansen** is an Associate Professor in the Economics Department at the University of Oxford. [On his website](https://sekhansen.github.io/) you can find course materials to his courses in text mining and machine learning.


## 2. Practical Tutorials (R)

### Basics on text mining

- In [Text Mining in R: A Tutorial](https://www.springboard.com/blog/text-mining-in-r/) you can learn the basics about text mining in R (reading in large files, text pre-processing, wordclouds, sentiment analysis, n-grams). The [full repository](https://github.com/Rogerh91/Springboard-Blog-Tutorials/tree/master/Text%20Mining%20in%20R%20Tutorial) with all of the files and data contains the whole code as well as the data.

- [Text Mining with R - a Tidy Approach](http://tidytextmining.com/index.html) is a website that contains a comprehensive overview of the [tidytext](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) (Silge and Robinson [2016](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305219559_tidytext_Text_Mining_and_Analysis_Using_Tidy_Data_Principles_in_R)) R package. It also contains a section about topic modeling (using the [topicmodels](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/topicmodels/vignettes/topicmodels.pdf) library in R.)

### Topic Modeling

- [Christine Doigs talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMu-bdoVrU) gives a great introduction to **topic modeling** and one of it's most widely used algorithms called LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).

- [A gentle introduction to topic modeling using R](https://eight2late.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/a-gentle-introduction-to-topic-modeling-using-r/) by Kailash Awati ([Eight to Late](https://eight2late.wordpress.com/)) The tutorial includes an intuitive explanation of how LDA works before moving on to a practical example which uses the [topicmodels](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/topicmodels/vignettes/topicmodels.pdf) library in R. He uses a collection of 30 posts from his blog as an example corpus, which can be freely downloaded.

- In his tutorial [Topic Modeling in R](http://davidmeza1.github.io/2015/07/20/topic-modeling-in-R.html) David Meza - a Chief Knowledge Architect at [NASA Johnson Space Center](https://www.nasa.gov/) - gives a non-technical overview of the LDA model. Using the publicly available Lessons Learned from the [NASA Engineering Network](https://llis.nasa.gov/), he sets up a LDA model using the [topicmodels](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/topicmodels/vignettes/topicmodels.pdf) library in R. He also determines k number of topics based on Martin Ponweiser's thesis, [Latent Dirichlet Allocation in R](http://epub.wu.ac.at/3558/1/main.pdf).

- A comprehensive explanation of the LDA was written by Ted Underwood in [this](https://tedunderwood.com/2012/04/07/topic-modeling-made-just-simple-enough/) article. He also created a [github folder](https://github.com/tedunderwood/BrowseLDA) containing few examples of complete topic models on collections of 18/19c volumes (with R scripts to load them).

- A way to implement the unsupervised LDA as a semi-supervised GuidedLDA was developed by Vikash Singh [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-we-changed-unsupervised-lda-to-semi-supervised-guidedlda-e36a95f3a164).
